## Constellation images and myths 

This folder contains images of constellations captured from app *PlanetFun*
and stories about myths and characters in western tradition constellations.

Some stories, like Andromeda's, include multiple constellations.

While images are original, the texts were generated by *AI chat bots* ( Bing and Bard )
and are loosely based on actual greek myths. I suppose.

If there are english errors, please blame on me, for I have made a few changes to original texts,
both interacting with the chat bot or changing the text directly. But those were small..
